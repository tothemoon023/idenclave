bsolutely! Here’s a detailed design document for your IDenclave MVP, including the current architecture, key components, and suggestions for components or features that are yet to be made. This will help you or any collaborator quickly get up to speed in a new conversation or handoff.
IDenclave MVP – Design Document
Project Overview
IDenclave is a decentralized identity and credential management system built on Solana. It enables users to register decentralized identities (DIDs), issue and store verifiable credentials (VCs) on IPFS, and generate zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for privacy-preserving verification.

1. Architecture Overview
Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite)
Blockchain: Solana (DID and credential smart contracts)
Storage: IPFS (for off-chain credential data)
ZKP: snarkjs (for proof generation/verification)
Wallet: Solana wallet adapter (Phantom, Solflare, etc.)

2. Key Components (Current & Planned)

A. Onboarding & UX
LandingPage.tsx: Hero section, wallet connect, feature highlights, onboarding modal.
HelpModal.tsx: Step-by-step onboarding guide with progress indicator.
HowItWorksSection.tsx: Visual explanation of the IDenclave flow.

B. Identity Management
DIDRegistration.tsx:
Registers a DID for the connected wallet.
Shows transaction signature and Solana Explorer link.
Handles registration status and errors.

C. Credential Management
CredentialIssuance.tsx:
Form for issuing credentials (type, claims, expiration).
Uploads credential to IPFS, stores hash on Solana.
Shows transaction signature and IPFS link.
Validates input and handles errors.
CredentialDashboard.tsx (Planned):
List and manage user’s issued and received credentials.
View credential details, status, and actions (e.g., generate proof).

D. Zero-Knowledge Proofs
ZKPVerification.tsx:
Allows user to upload/select circuit and zkey files.
Generates ZKPs for claims using snarkjs.
Displays proof and public signals (copy/export).
Verifies proof and shows result.
ZKPGenerator.tsx (Planned/Optional):
More user-friendly wizard for generating proofs for various credential types.
Templates for common proofs (e.g., “Over 18”, “KYC passed”).

E. General UI
NavBar.tsx: Navigation between main sections.
AboutSection.tsx, FAQSection.tsx, ContactSection.tsx: Informational and support content.

3. Backend/Smart Contract Integration
Solana Program:
Handles DID registration and credential issuance.
Stores references to IPFS hashes for credentials.
(Planned) Add support for credential revocation and updates.
IPFS:
Stores credential data off-chain.
Hashes are referenced on-chain for verification.
ZKP Circuits:
Circuits for common credential proofs (e.g., age, KYC).
(Planned) UI for uploading new circuits and keys.

4. Testing & Quality
Automated Tests:
Jest + React Testing Library for frontend logic and UI.
Mocked wallet, Solana, and IPFS for unit tests.
Manual Testing:
End-to-end flows for onboarding, registration, credential issuance, and proof generation.

5. Components/Features Yet to Be Made or Improved
A. Credential Dashboard
List all credentials (issued and received)
Actions: view, generate proof, revoke (if supported), share
B. Verifier Portal
UI for verifiers to submit and check proofs
Display verification results and credential details
C. Notifications/Toasts
User feedback for success, errors, and important actions
D. Circuit Management
UI for uploading/selecting ZKP circuits and keys
Templates for common proof types
E. Credential Revocation (Advanced)
Smart contract and UI for revoking credentials
F. Mobile Responsiveness & Accessibility
Ensure all flows are mobile-friendly and accessible
G. User Profile/Settings (Optional)
Manage DID, credentials, and preferences

6. Suggested Next Steps
Build out the CredentialDashboard and Verifier Portal.
Add notifications/toasts for better UX.
Expand ZKP support with more circuits and templates.
Add more robust error handling and edge-case tests.
Polish mobile and accessibility support.
